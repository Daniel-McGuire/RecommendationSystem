# TODO List

*Add style to new test-btn
*validation - if no location entered then alert and return false
*validation - only one selection at a time
*add text box or similar to results panel so text doesnt run past results div
*maybe add results into a table - not a neccessity. 

*Need to change database so it saves the location and results into the database. 
- If the same location is entered in the next 10hours(results unlikely to change on dbpedia) then retrieve the information from the database. 
- Otherwise, search semantic web.
